Welcome to Milk Admin, a ready-to-use admin panel written in PHP and designed to support the work of developers.
This system gives you a login, user and permission management and an external module installation and update system. 
Developed with a Bootstrap template and a lightweight and easy-to-learn framework for creating independent systems.

The system offers an excellent level of automatic protection from CSRF and SQL Injection, and all the basic security practices for login. 

Try it, the installation system is very fast and you can customize it for your needs. You will have access to a large documentation that will help you create your application. 
This way you can create your own webapp. Keeping it updated is even easier, you will only need, once you have finished making changes, a single shell command to create a new update version.


# what can you do?
Don't modify what you already use, but complement it with a lightweight and modular administrative system. The idea is to have a tool that's easy to learn and doesn't require the use of complex or invasive frameworks. MilkAdmin allows you to group your custom code under a single environment, giving you a code base to develop small web applications useful for your company's or your clients' work such as: CRUD, reports, dashboards, APIs, scheduled processes, or email management.
Thanks to the modular structure, you can easily collaborate with other people, dividing tasks and keeping development organized. Additionally, you can update both individual modules and the entire system with the same simplicity.



# How simple is it?

```php
Route::set('a_cup_of_milk', function() {
    Theme::set('javascript', Route::url().'/modules/a_cup_of_milk/assets/a_cup_of_milk.js');
     Get::theme_page('default', __DIR__ . '/assets/a_cup_of_milk.page.php');
}, '_user.is_authenticated');
```

This creates a page at the address ?page=a_cup_of_milk within the theme with custom javascript. Accessible only to authorized users.

If you want to add a new menu item in the sidebar, you just need to write:

```php 
 Theme::set('sidebar.links', ['url'=> '?page=a_cup_of_milk', 'title'=> 'A cup of milk', 'icon'=> 'bi-cup-hot-fill', 'order'=> 70] );
```

Is it simple enough? 


# Security
I tried to create a system with a high level of protection. The main features are:

Automatic CSRF for logged-in users and POST requests, and manual for other requests with a second level of protection.
SQL injection protection.
XSS protection.
Session timeout - I don't accept "stay logged in" and session controls with IP.
Login blocking after N failed attempts.
Registration is not present because it's designed for business or private use.
Various methods for protecting folders and files.
Public API or with JWT authentication

# Documentation

# Next Steps
In the demo I have already published some modules I'm working on. I hope to advance them and finish them by early 2026. 
The direction I want to give to this system is related to data monitoring and reporting.
